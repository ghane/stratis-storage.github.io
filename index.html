								stratis-cli 2.0.1 Release Notes
							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Sunday January 21, 2020</p>
<p>stratis-cli 2.0.1 contains a number of internal improvements as well as
some improvements to certain error messages.</p>
<p>We expect that most current users will notice very little if any change;
we hope that new users will benefit from error messages that they can
more directly relate to the commands that they have typed. In order to
achieve this, the internal exception hierarchy was refined, and some new
exception classes were added.</p>
<p>The man pages have been updated to include a precise specification of every
field displayed by any of the <code>list</code> subcommands.</p>
<p>Contributors to the source will observe that our CI now requires 100% code
coverage.</p>

								Cryptsetup Rust bindings release
							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Monday January 13, 2020</p>
<p>One major focus in the Stratis project recently has been adding an encryption layer
for data in Stratis pools. Cryptsetup provides a library backend for programmatically
setting up device encryption, so we decided to write Rust bindings to access the
existing Cryptsetup functionality in Rust.</p>
<p>While designing the bindings, we took every opportunity to make use of Rust's
type system, leveraging features like reference lifetimes and type parameters
to ensure that as much of our public API as possible can be validated by the
compiler.</p>
<p>Though these bindings were designed with Stratis in mind, it is intended
to be general-purpose and so we encourage others to try it out. The license
is MPLv2, but it becomes effectively GPL when linked with libcryptsetup.
As a result, any project using our bindings will also need to be GPL or
GPL-compatible.</p>
<p>If you're interested in seeing more, you can find <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/libcryptsetup-rs">the repository here</a>.</p>

								Stratis 2.0.0 Release Notes
							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Wednesday November 6, 2019</p>
<p>Stratis 2.0 is a significant update for both the daemon and the CLI. The
changes to the daemon are covered first, followed by the changes to the
CLI.</p>
<h2 id="stratisd-2-0-0">stratisd 2.0.0</h2>
<p>This release makes the D-Bus API more robust, reliable, predictable, and
extensible. There are several significant changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The set of D-Bus properties has been reduced to a core set of fundamental
and stable properties. Other filesystem, pool, or block devices properties are
now obtainable via methods in the <code>FetchProperties</code> interface. This change
increases the robustness of the D-Bus interface to failures occurring in any
particular pool, filesystem, or block device, and decreases the computational
cost of most operations requested by the Stratis CLI. Several properties,
formerly returned as D-Bus properties, are now unavailable by means of the
D-Bus. In every case, the reason for removing the property was that it did not
represent a well-defined value. See <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/52">project issue 52</a> for further details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All D-Bus method calls are idempotent. This should make writing scripts
using the D-Bus API much simpler and make reasoning about the behavior
of the engine more straightforward. Henceforth, we will treat as a bug any
non-idempotent behavior in the D-Bus API. See <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/51">project issue 51</a> for further
details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All D-Bus size values are now returned in bytes. Again, this should make
writing scripts against the D-Bus more straightforward, since it will be
unnecessary for the script writer to change their interpretation of the number
returned on the D-Bus depending on the value that it represents. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/issues/1243">stratisd issue 1243</a> for further details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Future enhancements to the D-Bus API will be implemented by means of
additional versioned interfaces.</p>
<p>Please consult the D-Bus API Reference for the precise D-Bus specification.</p>
<h2 id="stratis-cli-2-0-0">stratis-cli 2.0.0</h2>
<p>This release requires stratisd 2.0.0. The user will observe the following
significant improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The CLI is significantly more robust. Previously, there was a category of
error conditions in pools, filesystems, and block devices that would make the
CLI virtually unusable; this problem has now been entirely resolved. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/52">project issue 52</a> for further details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CLI now reports errors consistently in conditions where a human user
would generally expect an error to be reported. Previously, many commands in
the CLI were idempotent, to facilitate scripting. Now there is a clear
distinction between the CLI behavior and the stratisd D-Bus API behavior: the
CLI behavior is designed strictly according to the expectations of a human
user, the stratisd D-Bus API is the programmable interface. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/51">project issue 51</a> for further details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, anyone wishing to implement a program that uses Stratis for
storage management is strongly advised to make use of the stratisd D-Bus API
rather than the CLI.</p>

								stratis-cli 1.1.0 Release Notes
							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Wednesday October 2, 2019</p>
<p>With this release stratis now recognizes an environment variable,
<code>STRATIS_DBUS_TIMEOUT</code>. This environment variable controls the timeout for
any individual D-Bus call that stratis makes. You may want to set it to a
higher value than the default, which is 120 seconds, if you are running
tests or otherwise scripting via stratis, and wish to avoid erroneous errors
resulting from slow operations in your testing environment. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/issues/252">stratis-cli issue 252</a> for further details.</p>
<p>This release also introduces simplified and more complete error-reporting.
For stratis, it constitutes an error if any command issued results in a
Python stack trace. If you experience any such incident, please
report it in a GitHub issue, including the full stack trace, and
circumstances that led up to the incident.</p>

								stratisd 1.0.6 Release Notes
							  </a>
							</h1>
							<div class="post__summary">
								<p>Wednesday October 2, 2019</p>
<p>This release includes one significant bug fix and a substantial refactoring.</p>
<p>The bug was caused by an inconsistency in the metadata handling which led to
a failure to properly update the Stratis metadata if stratisd was restarted
in an environment where the system clock indicated a time earlier than when
it had previously been running. See <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/issues/1509">stratisd issue 1509</a> for further
details.</p>
<p>This release also includes significant refactoring of the stratisd metadata
handling for clarity and modularity and to use types to enforce distinctions
among the sizes of different metadata regions (<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/issues/1573">stratisd issue 1573</a>).</p>

<h1 id="new-features">New Features</h1>
<h2 id="initial-stable-stratis-release">Initial Stable Stratis Release</h2>
<p>Stratis is a Linux local storage management tool that aims to enable easy use of advanced storage features such as thin provisioning, snapshots, and pool-based management and monitoring.</p>
<p>After two years of development, Stratis 1.0 has stabilized its on-disk metadata format and command-line interface, and is ready for more widespread testing and evaluation by potential users. Stratis is implemented as a daemon – <code>stratisd</code> – as well as a command-line configuration tool called stratis, and works with Linux kernel versions 4.14 and up.</p>

								<p>March 8, 2018</p>
<p>This release is suitable for developers and early testers. It should not be
used with valuable data, and pools created with this release will not be
